# COVID Cough Audio Classification 

## Description 
Over the course of this pandemic many people have contracted COVID-19 and developed a cough. Can we use machine learning to help screen individuals in order to relieve some of the strain on the medical field? The goal of this project is to build a cough detection model with the recorded sound datasets that characterizes whether a person has a respiratory illness or not based on provided personal information. The COUGHVID dataset provides over 25,000 crowdsourced cough recordings representing a wide range of participant ages, genders, geographic locations, and COVID-19 statuses.
